## About

We have a complete API developed with Node.js and Express, which connects to the [front-end](https://github.com/denilsonbaptista/food-explorer-web) of Food Explorer. We will use Insomnia to register our routes and verify their status codes. The database will be created using SQLite, and we will manage it with Beekeeper Studio, along with the Knex.js Query Builder for query manipulation.
